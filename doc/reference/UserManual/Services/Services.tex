\section{Adding New Services: Step-By-Step}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make copies of the service template source and header files:
\begin{docspec}
    uxas/code/src/Services/00\_ServiceTemplate.cpp
\end{docspec}
\begin{docspec}
    uxas/code/src/Services/00\_ServiceTemplate.h
\end{docspec}
\item Change the name of the copied files to reflect the name of the new service.
\item In the new files, search for the string \textit{c00\_ServiceTemplate} and Replace it with the new service name.
\item Change the unique include guard entries in the header file, i.e. \textit{UXAS\_00\_SERVICE\_TEMPLATE\_H}, to match the new service name.
\item Edit the file:
\begin{docspec}
    uxas/code/src/Services/00\_ServiceList.h
\end{docspec}
to add entries for the new service:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item include the header file for the new service in the section labeled \textit{SERVICE HEADER FILES SECTION}, e.g.:
\begin{docspec}
\#include "CmasiAreaSearchTaskService.h"
\end{docspec}
  
  \item add a service registration string in the section labeled \textit{SERVICE REGISTRATION SECTION} e.g.:
\begin{docspec}
{auto svc = uxas::stduxas::make\_unique<afrl::cmasi::AreaSearchTask>();}
\end{docspec}
  \item if the new service is a task, include the header file of the corresponding task message in the section labeled \textit{INCLUDE TASK MESSAGES SECTION}, e.g.:
\begin{docspec}
\#include "afrl/cmasi/AreaSearchTask.h"
\end{docspec} 
  \item if the new service is a task, add a subscription string in the section labeled \textit{SUBSCRIBE TO TASKS SECTION}, e.g.:
\begin{docspec}
addSubscriptionAddress(afrl::cmasi::AreaSearchTask::AREASEARCHTASK\_FULL\_LMCP\_TYPE\_NAME);
\end{docspec} 
  \end{enumerate}  
\end{enumerate}


\section{Configuring Services}
Service are configured using a global configuration file written in XML. The configuration file is selected either  by using the default configuration file name: \textbf{\textit{cfg.xml}} or passing in the path/filename when starting UxAS:
\begin{docspec}
	uxas\_main \textbf{-cfgPath} \textit{../PathToConfigurationFile/cfgFileName.xml}
\end{docspec} 
The elements contained in an UxAS configuration file are, \textbf{XML Declaration}, \textbf{UxAS Element}, \textbf{Service Elements}, and \textbf{Bridge Elements}, see Figure \ref{fig:configExample}. 
\begin{marginfigure}[-100pt]
	\includegraphics[width=1.3\linewidth]{\FiguresPath//ConfigExample}
	\caption{Sample configuration file}
	\label{fig:configExample}
\end{marginfigure}

Here is the \textbf{XML Declaration}:
\begin{docspec}<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>\end{docspec}
The \textbf{UxAS Element}:
\begin{docspec}
	<UxAS EntityID="1000" FormatVersion="1.0" EntityType="Aircraft">
\end{docspec}
accepts the following attributes:
\begin{description}
	\item[\textit{EntityID}] Identification number of the entity represented by this instance of UxAS
	%\item[\textit{FormatVersion}] description ??????
	\item[\textit{EntityType}] used to differentiate between entities such as, \textit{Aircraft} and \textit{UGS}. Entries are defined by the services that use them.
	\item[\textit{ConsoleLoggerSeverityLevel}] if this attribute is present, all log messages at or below the severity level are displayed in the console. Valid entries are: \textit{DEBUG}, \textit{INFO}, \textit{WARN}, and \textit{ERROR}
	\item[\textit{MainFileLoggerSeverityLevel}] if this attribute is present, all log messages at or below the severity level are save in log files. Valid entries are: \textit{DEBUG}, \textit{INFO}, \textit{WARN}, and \textit{ERROR}
	%\item[\textit{StartDelay\_ms}] description
	\item[\textit{RunDuration\_s}] UxAS will run for \textit{RunDuration\_s} seconds before terminating.
	%\item[\textit{isLoggingThreadId}] description
\end{description}
Service Elements configure the services. There can be as many Service Elements as required. The attributes of the Service Elements are the options defined by each service. For example, the HelloWorld service can be configured with the following Service Element:
\begin{docspec}
	<Service Type="HelloWorld" StringToSend="Hello from \#1" SendPeriod\_ms="1000"/>
\end{docspec}
Bridge Elements configure bridges, which are services that create communication connections. For the Distributed Cooperation example, the zyre connection is configured with the following Bridge Element:
\begin{docspec}
    <Bridge Type="LmcpObjectNetworkZeroMqZyreBridge" NetworkDevice="enx281878b9065a">
	\quad<SubscribeToExternalMessage MessageType="uxas.messages.task.AssignmentCoordination"/>
	</Bridge>
\end{docspec}



\section{Core Services}\label{core-services}

The core services of UxAS work in concert to carry out the \emph{task assignment pipeline}
which automates the calculation of the proper vehicle-task orderings for efficient overall
mission completion. The design choice to seperate each of these services is motivated by
consideration of computational complexity as well as availability in the literature for
parts of the process (i.e. route planners and task assignment algorithms).

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{\CCAFiguresPath//CCA_Components_MessageFLow}
	\caption{Message Flow for Task Assignment Pipeline}
	\label{fig:CoreServiceMessageFlow}
\end{figure*}

The message flow between the core services is captured in Figure~\ref{fig:CoreServiceMessageFlow}
and indicates the temporal relationship between the core services in carrying out a complete
automation request. Time proceeds from the top of the diagram to the bottom with
each horizontal arrow representing a single LMCP message of the specified type.

\begin{description}
\item
  \textbf{\textit{AutomationRequestValidatorService}} - This service will check an outside
  automation request for feasibility. If any task, vehicle, or operating region in the request
  has not yet been described to the system, this service will return an error indicating that
  the request cannot be fulfilled. If all necessary parts of the request are available to the
  system, then this service will attach a unique identifier to the request and start the
  sequence of steps necessary to fulfill that request. If any other outside requests are made
  while the system is in the process of fulfilling an existing request, this service will queue
  those additional requests, ensuring that the system only handles one request at a time. 
\item
  \textbf{\textit{TaskManagerService}} - This service dynamically creates new task services as
  their descriptions are sent into the system. When a new \textit{Task} is described, this service
  will send the proper configuration message for construction of a new service that adheres to
  the general task interface specification for that particular \textit{Task}. As part of the task
  service construction, this service will pass along all relevant details that a \textit{Task}
  needs for calculation of its behavior (i.e. current vehicle states, defined areas of interest, etc).
\item
  \textbf{\textit{Task}} - Tasks make up the atomic building blocks of automation requests. The
  composition of tasks and the assignment of particular vehicles to tasks comprises an automation
  response. When included as part of an automation request, a \textit{Task} reports a set of
  possible \emph{options} which represent the possible ways that the task can be completed. Each
  option is precisely a start and end location for applicable vehicles as well as the cost to
  complete the task using that option. The location and cost information for each option is used
  by the assignment service to select an option for each task that completes the overall mission
  efficiently. Once an option is selected by the assignment service, each \textit{Task} also
  reports the set of waypoints that a vehicle should use to complete the task.
\item
  \textbf{\textit{RoutePlannerVisibilityService}} - One of potentially many route planners, this
  service fulfills simple requests for routing in complex environments. For a given environment
  (described by sets of \textit{KeepIn} and \textit{KeepOut} polygons), a route planner will
  calculate the appropriate waypoints to guide a vehicle from a prescribed start location to a
  desired end location, ensuring that no waypoint is placed in an invalid area. This particular
  route planner uses a visibility graph as a basis to create distance-minimizing routes in two
  dimensions. Route planning services have a simple request-reply interface with each request
  corresponding to a single vehicle in a single environment.
\item
  \textbf{\textit{RouteAggregatorService}} - This service works with a set of route planners,
  requesting routes from the appropriate planner based on the situation. Additionally, this service
  provides the capability to make large-scale route planning requests involving multiple vehicles
  and multiple start/end locations. A primary use of this service is to calculate routes for all
  vehicles to travel between task locations. By orchestrating the cost-to-go calculations
  between tasks, this service acts as the bookkeeper for the complete cost map required by
  assignment algorithms.
\item
  \textbf{\textit{AssignmentTreeBranchBoundService}} - This service provides a resource allocation
  algorithm to determine an efficient use of the vehicle assets to fulfill tasks in the system. By
  design, the resource allocation is de-coupled from route planning and only uses the costs
  provided by the \textit{RouteAggregatorService}. The ultimate output of this service is an ordered
  list of tasks for each vehicle. This ordering must account for the process algebra relationship
  between tasks. This particular assignment service builds a tree of possible assignment orderings
  and prunes that tree based on the prescribed task relationships. The algorithm proceeds in two phases:
  1) greedy, depth-first search to find a feasible plan; 2) backtracking up the tree in a
  branch-and-bound manner to discover plans that are lower cost than the initial greedy plan. Once a
  predetermined amount of the tree has been searched (to ensure worst-case execution time), the
  assignment service will return the most efficient task ordering discovered.
\item
  \textbf{\textit{PlanBuilderService}} - With a task ordering determined by the assignment service,
  the \textit{PlanBuilderService} will organize the final set of waypoints that each vehicle should
  follow to complete the assignment. Working through the task ordering, this service requests the
  appropriate \textit{Tasks} in the assigned order to build a complete set of waypoints for each
  vehicle to carry out the mission. By stitching each part of the mission together in the proper
  order, this service provides the automation response that fulfills the original, outside
  automation request.

What follows are details for each of the core services and a rough description of the state machines
that each follows to complete its part of the overall task assignment process. See the auto-generated
LMCP documentation for precise details of each message.
