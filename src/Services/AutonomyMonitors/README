Plan for implementing a monitoring service
Sriram Sankaranarayanan and Guohui Ding


1. Objective:

   We will collect information regarding
      (a) the operating region KeepIn/Out zones
      (b) the tasks
      (c) the relationship between tasks as
          captured by the process algebra string.
      (d) the vehicles that are going to perform the tasks
      (e) the states of these vehicles
      (f) the waypoints that are fed to the vehicles.
      (g) the TaskActive/TaskComplete messages received
      (g) any sort of time and energy constraints on the overall mission
      	  completion.

2. As the plan is being implemented:

      (a) The operating regions are maintained "robustly" even in the presence of disturbances. I.e, vehicles do not enter the KeepOut zones.
         TODO: Find out what the semantics of the KeepIn zones are.

      (b) Monitor completion for various task types: use
      	  robustness semantics to capture how "robustly"
	  the tasks are completed.
	  TODO: Formulate these semantics and important assumptions
	        with Guohui
	  
      (c) Monitor overall mission status and assign a robustness score
      	  to the overall mission success/failure status.



Implementation Details

We will implement a service that captures the important messages related
to the AutomationRequests, Tasks, VehicleConfiguration and States.
Once this information is collected and the plan implementation begins, we will
monitor entity states continuously.

- End-to-End Verification

   Using the reported vehicle states, are the tasks actually being
   completed as specified.


- Implementation Verification

  Is the planner working correctly?
