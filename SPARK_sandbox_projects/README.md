"Sandbox" Projects for OpenUxAS written in SPARK
================================================================================

This directory contains projects that are related to, but not central to,
OpenUxAS that have been developed in SPARK Ada 2014.

You can get SPARK Ada from AdaCore at: https://www.adacore.com/download You will
want to get both GNAT GPL Ada as well as SPARK Discovery. Note that SPARK
Discovery ships with a reduced set of theorem provers, so you may not be able to
fully replicate the success described here. You can manually install and add
theorem provers to SPARK Discovery, if needed.
