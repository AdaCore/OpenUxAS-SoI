        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        CMASI message definitions. The Common Mission Automation Services Interface (CMASI) defines data relevant to mission planning and
        UAV autonomy. Direct any questions to Matt Duquette (matthew.duquette@wright.edu).
        <br/>
        <p>CMASI is designed for machine-to-machine communication of information related to UAV mission planning.  It is designed
        to provide a minimum set of data for that purpose.  It is envisioned that end-users would expand on the base data set
        by making custom messages that extend from existing data types.</p>

        <p><i>Note on units:</i> Unless otherwise specified, the units of measure [meters, kilograms, milliSeconds, degrees] are used.  Since this is a system
        for machine-to-machine communication, end applications are expected to do appropriate conversions to and from the MKSD unit types.</p>

        <p><i>Note on Earth coordinates:</i>Unless otherwise specified, latitudes and longitudes are assumed to be based on the
        WGS84 ellipsoid/datum and EGM96 gravitational model.  Altitude is the height above mean sea level for a given point.
        (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS-84</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM96">EGM96</a>
        for more info)</p>
        <p>Note on directions:  Unless otherwise noted, all directional angles are relative to true North.</p>
        <p>Note on IDs:  Many types have scenario-wide unique ids associated with them (VehicleID, TaskID, etc.)  These IDs should not be zero.</p>

            <li>Added aspect ratio comment in {@link CameraConfiguration}.
            <li>Changed documentation in {@link VehicleInfo} to denote use of {@link Location2D} or
            {@link Location3D} objects for "StartPoint" and "EndPoint".
            <li>Added note regarding end-of-route behavior in {@link MissionCommand}.

            "VideoStreamConfigurationList" from {@link AirVehicleConfiguration}.
            <li>Added "Priority" and "Required" fields to {@link Task}.
            <li>Created {@link WeatherReport}.

        <ul>
        <li>Fixed missing type in "UseInertialViewAngles" in {@link LineSearchTask}
        </ul>

        <h3>20 August 2010</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Changed default altitude to Mean-sea-level from Height-above-ellipsoid</li>
        <li>Added note in main documentation regarding "zero" in ids
        <li>Changed documentation for "ContingencyPoint" in {@link Waypoint}
        <li>Removed WavelengthBand from {@link CameraAction} and changed WavelengthBands to WavelengthBand (array to scalar) in {@link CameraConfiguration}
        <li>Removed framerate information from {@link CameraConfiguration} and {@link SearchTask}
        <li>Renamed "FlightMode" to {@link NavigationMode}
        <li>Added "Hover" to {@link LoiterType} and updated {@link LoiterAction} to reflect the use of Axis in hover-mode.
        <li>Added Min, Max, and Min AGL altitudes to {@link AirVehicleConfiguration}
        <li>Updated documentation for Min/Max altitudes in {@link VehicleInfo}.
        <li>Added start and end points in {@link VehicleInfo}.
        <li>Improved (hopefully) the view angle documentation in {@link LineSearchTask}.
        <li>Updated documentation in {@link Wedge}.
        </ul>

        <h3>10 August 2010</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Changed "ContingencyWaypoint" type from {@link Waypoint} to uint32 in {@link Waypoint}.
        <li>Renamed "LostCommPoint" to "ContingencyPoint" in {@link VehicleInfo} and updated the documentation.

        <li>Addded "AvailableFramerates" to {@link CameraConfiguration}.
        <li>Changed "WaypointMode" enum to {@link FlightMode}.  WaypointMode was a misnomer, since the enum describes many flight states, "WaypointFollow" being

        <li>Added "AvailableLoiterTypes" and "AvailableTurnTypes" to {@link AirVehicleConfiguration} to denote vehicle capabilities.
        <li>Removed "AssignedAltitude" from {@link AirVehicleConfiguration} since altitude can be assigned using {@link VehicleInfo} object in {@link AutomationRequest}
        The presence of "AssignedAltitude" caused ambiguity in planning situations.  (which takes precedence?)
        <li>Added "CurrentCommand" to {@link AirVehicleState} to denote the VehicleActionCommand or MissionCommand currently being executed.
        <li>Improved documentation in {@link Wedge}.
        </ul>

        The definition of ViewAngle is based on the type of task.</li>
        <li>Removed "Azimuth" and "Elevation" from {@link LineSearchTask}. Replaced with "ViewAngleList"</li>
        <li>Added {@link KeyValuePair} to replace many existing string fields with a more structured set of data</li>
        <li>Replaced string fields with {@link KeyValuePair} type to enable structured maps of data in {@link Task}, {@link OperatorSignal}, {@link AutomationResponse},
        {@link ServiceStatus}, {@link SessionStatus}.</li>
        <li>Added "CommandID" in {@link VehicleActionCommand} and {@link MissionCommand}</li>
        <li>Added {@link CommandStatusType} enum
        <li>Added "Status" fields in {@link VehicleActionCommand} and {@link MissionCommand}.
        <li>Updated documentation to {@link VehicleInfo} to clarify the meaning of min/max altitudes.
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>Changed version tag to "2".
        <li>Replaced references to "No Fly" to "Keep Out".
        <li>Added "Length" parameter in {@link LoiterAction}.
        <li>Fixed azimuth and elevation fields in {@link LineSearchTask} to reflect inertial coordinates.
        <li>Updated comments in {@link AirVehicleState} regarding body angles.
        <li>Added "Visual" to {@link ZoneAvoidanceType} enum.
        <li>Added vertical component to {@link Wedge}.
        <li>Added "ContingencyWaypoint" field in {@link Waypoint}.
        <li>Added {@link AutomationResponse} type.
        <li>Changed "PlanRequest" to {@link AutomationRequest}.
        <li>Added "UseAltitude" field in {@link MustFlyTask}.
        <li>Moved "Boundary" from {@link KeepInZone} and {@link KeepOutZone} into {@link AbstractZone}.
        <li>Added {@link RemoveZones} and {@link RemoveAirVehicles} types.
        <li>Added {@link FlightDirectorAction} type.
        </ul>
