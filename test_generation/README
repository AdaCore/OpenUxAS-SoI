1. Rename libstdc++.so.6 in $MATLAB_FOLDER/sys/os/glnxa64. Otherwise Matlab uses this lib which can conflict with the system's libstd and cause uxas to crash when started from Matlab.
2. In struct2xml.m (external dependency downloaded from Matlab file exchange), change the line containing “str = [];” with “str = ‘’;” in the val2str() function. This avoids issues with empty xml tags.
3. Remove any commented out tags in the xml files. Otherwise xml2struct function can not correctly extract the xml structure.
4. Correct the local path dependencies in the files “staliro_uxas_demo.m” and in “uxas_blackbox.m” (or the corresponding test setup files).
5. Make sure the simulation time for AMASE scenario configuration is larger than the simulation time used to call staliro.
6. See uxas examples folder, 06_Test_WaterwaySearch folder for xml configuration examples.
