# Purpose

This folder contains artifacts produced in the Summer of Innovation by members of the SoI team following a "tracer-bullet" approach, with the purpose of deriving a methodology that leverages prevailing safety aviation standards supported by rationale captured in an assurance argument.

# Contents

### ArgumentFragments

Argument fragments specific to this exploration expressed in Goal Structuring Notation.

### ASSERT

This folder contains working files for the ASSERTâ„¢ tool developed by General Electric for requirements capture, formalization, analysis, and test case generation. Requirements of two UxAS components have been captured: <tt>AutomationRequestValidator</tt> <tt>and RouteRequestAggregator</tt>. Ontologies used for formalization are stored in the "Data\_Model" folders. Formalized requirements are stored in the "Requirement\_Model" folders. The <tt>AutomationRequestValidator</tt> example also includes test case generation.

The folder "UxAS-Ontology" contains ontologies extracted from the OpenUxAS software. They are used to provide the semantics needed for requirements formalization.

### Hazard\_Analysis

Tables containing fragments of Preliminary Hazard Analysis, Functional Hazard Analysis and Requirements allocated to functions, sub-functions and individual UxAS services. 

### SOTERIA

Working files for the SOTERIA tool used to generate fault trees from models.
