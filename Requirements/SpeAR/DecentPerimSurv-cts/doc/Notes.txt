Notes:

x = pos
p = goal

(Goal) Algorithm:
* If I meet a neighbor:
*  If I'm to the left of my segment (x< pl), go to the left endpoint of my segment (p = pl).
*  If I'm to the right of my segment (x > pr), go to the right endpoint of my segment (p = pr).
*  If I'm inside my segment (pl <= x <= pr),
		If I'm meeting my left neighbor, p = pl
		If I'm meeting my right neighbor, p = pl
		If I'm meeting both neighbors, p = pl (go with left).

Events that can happen:		
For all i, u_i.x = u_i.p (somebody hit their goal)
Or
	0: u1.x = 0 (hit left endpoint)
	1: u1.x = u2.x
	2: u2.x = u3.x
	...
	   u(n-1).x = un.x
	   un.x = P
