OpenUxAS Arguments
------------------

This directory contains an incomplete set of fragmentary arguments that have been developed for OpenUxAS as part of the Summer of Innovation. The arguments tackle various aspects of the system, from overall systems engineering through requirements elicitation to details about how requirements are satisfied via architecture.

Many of the arguments have been developed using Dependable Computing's SCT Lite, a graphical GSN argument editor. These files have the extension `.gsn`, but are human-readable XML files. For each `.gsn` file, there is also an associated PDF so that the arguments may be viewed without use of the editor. 

In addition to the GSN arguments, there are also "cartoons" of many of the arguments. These cartoons provide heavily abstracted views of the claims, inferences and evidence in the arguments and are useful for high-level discussions and presentations for which full detail would be inappropriate. The cartoons were developed using OmniGraffle and are also included in PDF.
